Encapsulation:
1. WE have made variables as private

    a) setter / getter
    b) constructors/getter
    c) constructor/getter/setter
    d) private methods is encapsulated within public method

    Constructors are primarily used for initializing object attributes when the object is created,
    while setter methods are used to modify attribute(update) values after the object has been instantiated.

    Constructors can be used to set multiple values at a time but setters ideally are used to set one value at a time,
    even though we can use it to set multiple values but we avoid it as this is against SRP principal,
    this SRP principal is not applied on constructors as they are not methods.
    That means setter method should have only one parameter at a time and hence it’s a bad idea to overload a setter method.
    NOTE: both constructors and setters’ methods are used to set the value of global variables only and
    we ideally should’t be implementing logic withing them, to implement logic, we should use, methods
