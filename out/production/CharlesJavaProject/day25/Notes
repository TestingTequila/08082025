Constructor are like methods which are used to
initialize objects(assign some meaningful value to the global/class level/instance variable) of a class

How do we create constructor:
1. The name of the constructor is same as the name of the class
2. The constructor will not have return type including void

Remember: A constructor is called automatically the moment we create object of the class
